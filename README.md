### Why?
[MLB Gameday](http://www.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/#) and [MLB.tv](http://mlb.tv) are
great, but sometimes you want to keep an eye on a game a bit more discreetly.
`playball` puts the game in a terminal window.

### Quick Start

```
$ npx playball

Ready for the big leagues? Install the package globally

$ npm install -g playball
```
Then run it
```

$ docker run -it --rm --name playball playball:latest
```

### Configuration

Playball can be configured using the `config` subcommand. To list the current configuration values run the subcommand with no additional arguments:

```shell
playball config
```

You should see output similar to:

```
color.ball = green
color.favorite-star = yellow
color.in-play-no-out = blue
color.in-play-out = white
color.in-play-runs-bg = white
color.in-play-runs-fg = black
color.on-base = yellow
color.other-event = white
color.out = red
color.strike = red
color.strike-out = red
color.walk = green
favorites = 
```

To get the value of a single setting pass the key as an additional argument:

```shell
playball config color.strike
```

To change a setting pass the key and value as arguments:

```shell
playball config color.strike blue
```

To revert a setting to its default value provide the key and the `--unset` flag:

```shell
playball config color.strike --unset
```

This table summarizes the available settings:

key | description | default | allowed values
----|-------------|---------|---------------
`color.ball` | Color of dots representing balls in top row of game view | green | One of the following: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`, `grey`. Any of those colors may be prefixed by `bright-` or `light-` (for example `bright-green`). The exact color used will depend on your terminal settings. The value `default` may be used to specify the default text color for your terminal. Finally hex colors (e.g `#FFA500`) can be specified. If your terminal does not support true color, the closest supported color may be used.
